# How Generative AI Works?

We need to how it works as this is what the world is evolving towards.

## AI 101

We are having dinner together and you ask me to pass you the salt. I've already been trained in trillions of different salt shakers earlier. AI works the same, you feed it with thousands, millions of content, then you teach it a certain algorithm to generate outputs and solutions as a result.

## Generative AI 101

Let's use cars as an example. Just like a Porsche has a different engine than a Mazda, under the umbrella term of generative AI, there are a variety of different generative AI models. These AI models, or car engines, are written and manufactured by groups of highly advanced computer vision specialists, machine learning experts, and mathematicians. They're built on years of open source machine learning research and generally funded by companies and universities. **_Some of the big players in writing these generative AI models_**, engines, are

1. Open AI,
2. NVIDIA,
3. Google, Meta,
4. and universities like UC Berkeley and LMU Munich.

They can either keep these models private, or they can make them public, what we call this, open source, for those to benefit from their research. All right, now that these complex generative models are written, meaning the engines are made, what are we going to do with them? Depending on your level of technical expertise, this can look a bit different. I'm going to paint a picture for you with three different end users of these models.

1. The first person is a business leader who comes up with a product idea that involves a generative AI model, or several. For the development of their tool, this business leader either uses free open source generative AI models (i.e. https://huggingface.com) or enters into a partnership with a corporation (https://colab.research.google.com) to get rights to their generative AI model, then their team creates their vision. To continue the chronology, let's say this person owns the car factory. They direct where the engine and chassis go, but don't actually work on the floor.
2. The second person is a creative person with an appetite for adventure. They might have some technical knowledge, but they aren't an AI engineer. I mean, they can be if they want. This person goes to a car engine showroom, where they pick a pre-made car engine or a generative AI model from a repository like [GitHub](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion). After that, they go to a chassis manufacturer to pick their empty shell for their new engine, their precious new engine. These chassis are called AI notebooks. Their purpose is to hold and run the generative AI model code. The most widely used one is **_Google Colab_**, but there are others like **_Jupiter Notebooks_**.
3. And the third person would be my mother, bless her heart. She has absolutely no technical pedigree, nor she's interested in acquiring one. But this doesn't mean she cannot benefit from generative AI. My mother would be buying her already made car. She will have way less control over the outcome of her car, but she will be able to drive, just like the business leader and the creative technologist. People with no technical knowledge can simply subscribe to an online service like OpenAI's ChatGPT or DALL-E, or download Discord and play with Midjourney, or download Lensa AI and Avatar Maker in their smartphone to play with the magic of generative AI. Well, this all depends what you want to do and what you want to build, and how much technical expertise you already have. Now that we have our car, our generative AI model, we can now start creating our own content and go for a drive. for example, as a developer I can use Claud.ai to help me with my development work when I need to use it to benefit me in my work.
