# The importants of Generative AI

- The advent of generative AI can be likened to the invention of photography and celluloid film, a true creative revolution. With photography, we no longer needed to rely on the interpretation of an artist to capture reality, and with generative AI, we no longer need artistic talent to draw or to sing. We can access now concise information in just a manner of seconds. We can also automatically generate text such as news articles or product descriptions. We can even design custom products like shoes or furniture.

  We can produce music, speech, visual effects, 3D assets and sound effects **_using algorithms trained on already existing data_**. I know you're like, it all sounds magic, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. But like Arthur C. Clark said, any sufficiently advanced technology is simply undistinguishable from magic. These machines are becoming 24 hours, seven assistants ready to perform a variety of tasks for us, resulting in the manifestation of our vision almost in real time. By training on large data sets, we can reduce the burden of repetitive tasks and complex computations, enabling us to focus on more creative and more strategic activities which is the very essence of what work is really about. The development of generative AI has a very rich and very fascinating history marked by significant breakthroughs, even though it gained widespread attention in 2022, its evolution was built on decades of mathematical research, starting with auto encoder neural networks in 2006 and continuing on through the mass adoption of generative AI models like DALL E, ChatGPT by Open ai, Kubrick, Journey and others today. Not only have the providers and services expanded but the quality of what is being produced has improved drastically as well. Like you can see in this chart by our world in data the exponential improvement in the quality of images generated between 2014 and 2022. While the pictures in 2014 are black and white and extremely pixelated. In 2022, we would simply type any word on the screen and generate coherent outcomes. Generative AI is not only changing almost every single profession, but it is also changing our understanding of what work is. Large parts of the production process that are repetitive or can be computational are now starting to be facilitated by AI models. All of this leads to the chance we are given to discover the essence of what it means to be a human and the true meaning of work.

A beautiful new existence awaits us where we focus on what makes us unique as a species,

1. our curiosity,
2. our conscious awareness,
3. our dreams,
4. our emotional intelligence,
5. and our vision

While the algorithms we have created **_assist us in the production and the execution_** of our authentic vision.
