# [What is Generative AI?](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/what-is-generative-ai/generative-ai-is-a-tool-in-service-of-humanity?resume=false)

I am taking this AI training course on the LinkedIn Learning platform because I am working on a couple of AI Software Development projects and I need to better understand a high level of Generative AI technology to ensure I excel in my job as software engineer focused on AI Software Engineering. I have been studying other AI Tech training courses on LinkedIn Learning as it is the type of software engineer that I am look to stay working within long term and staying on top of this type of tech is important for my career as a Security Software Engineer.

I am studying this training course around studying for the Offensive Security Essential CyberCore 100 (SEC-100) certification as it is important I stay on top of cybersecurity and particularly the following areas of cybersecurity:

1. Website application security including secure coding, DevSecOps, encryption & encoding.
2. AI security: cyber criminals (black hats) today are using AI powered software to exploite and break in to website applications and software application. Therefore, it is important we software developer (white hats) understand how to use AI tech to help us defend our AI software applications.
3. Cloud security: today much of software on the market is on the cloud and there are a number of cloud providers. It is important for software engineers today to understand how we can best defend our application and assets in the cloud no matter which cloud service provider we use.

## Cybersecurity & Intelligence

Five years ago when I started out as a trainee software engineer, I was working within Cybersecurity & Intelligence for a defence contractor which included 12 weeks full-time studying at the 2019 Women in Cyber Accademy. Within this accademy I had learnt AI & Machine Learning concepts and features as well as DevSecOps and defensive programming. When I graduated from the accademy I worked within cybersecurity & intelligence as a graduate software engineer for a defence contractor. From there I worked my way up the career ladder as Junior Software Engineer for the same employer and for a couple of years. This is why I am so committed to personal development to stay on top of the moving cybersecurity technology such as secure coding, AI Security and Cloud Security.

## Current Project

I have been working on the Knowledge Commons AI Software Development project (with a month break to focus on my big home move) and this has been a fantasic experience for my career in software development. I am working on this project around studying for the SEC-100 certification and I use Fridays for my software development training to stay on top of the JavaScript programming language such as TypeScript JS, React JS, Next JS, Tailwind CSS, CSS3, Node JS with Express JS for backend development.

## Resources

To stay on top of the technology within software development I use the Udemy training platform and the LinkedIn Learning platform. As well as YouTube and other online open source resources such as Stack Overflow and MDN Web Docs.

I use Claude.ai to support me in my software development work. To collaborate with other tech professionals I use Slack, GitHub and Discord platforms and they have been working well for me.
